### Database Management System (DBMS) Topics to Prepare

1. Relational Databases ✔
   - SQL (Structured Query Language)
   - ACID Properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
   - Transactions

2. Database Design
   - Entity-Relationship (ER) Model
   - Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
   - Denormalization

3. Query Optimization
   - Query Execution Plans
   - Indexing (Types of Indexes: B-Tree, Hash, etc.)
   - Query Tuning

4. Data Integrity ✔
   - Constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, Check)
   - Referential Integrity

5. Data Models 
   - Relational Model
   - NoSQL (Document, Key-Value, Columnar, Graph databases)

6. Database Administration (DBA)
   - Backup and Recovery
   - Replication
   - Security and Permissions

7. Distributed Databases
   - CAP Theorem
   - Consistency Models (Strong Consistency, Eventual Consistency)

8. Scalability and Performance
   - Horizontal Scaling vs. Vertical Scaling
   - Partitioning and Sharding

9. ACID vs. BASE
   - BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent)

10. NewSQL Databases
